#Custom image build with lfs tooling. NECESSARY. It can also be a custom image in their registry that is specified in the deploy.image: key here
build:
  lfs:

    dockerfile: Dockerfile


#Because Okteto does not natively support Git LFS, we need to manually pull the LFS files
#Now, with all the LFS files we are able to build the application image and deploy the application with Compose
